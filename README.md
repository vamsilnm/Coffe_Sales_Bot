# Coffe_Sales_Bot
Mainly Chat Bot is built for ordering a coffee,cappuccino, black coffee,tea or any other similar beverage along with a choice of almond or soy milk. 
Sorry spell correction is not yet built so please see to it.

Now One feature which is worth having is update my order so after user has given the order he will be given an option and will be asked whether.Your above Displayed order is final:
(Yes/No) are only allowed here and if yes then it will proceed and will be back with order and
then also if you did not like the order u can go for changing it. Now while changing it you can try
your best to confuse the bot by asking you to change or update the order like (Update coffee or
Update cofffee with soy milk) or just only update and then the flow follows.
But Before giving the first order if you ask for a update then it will raise a exception asking you
to first order before changing it.
